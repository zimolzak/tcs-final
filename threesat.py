# Write a function solve_3SAT using the search-tree technique outlined
# below that takes as its input a 3-SAT instance (see Problem Set 2),
# applies pre-processing (see Problem Set 4), and then uses a search tree
# to find if the given instance has a satisfying assignment. Your function
# should return None if the given instance of 3SAT has no satisfying
# assignment and otherwise return a satisfying assignment.

# Take any clause that is not satisfied
# * If all variables have already been set, then there is no
#   possible solution anymore
# * Otherwise, branch into at most three cases where in each case a different
#   variable is set so that the clause becomes satisfied:
#  - The first variable is set so that clause becomes satisfied
#    (and we don't do anything with the other variables)
#  - The first variable is set so that clause does not becomes satisfied,
#    the second one is set so that it becomes satisfied and we don't do
#    anything with the third variable.
#  - The first and second variable are set so that the clause does not
#    become satisfied, the third one is set so that it does become satisfed.

# Note that any solution must fall into one of the above categories.
# Naturally, after having applied the pre-processing and also during the
# branching, some clauses will not contain three unassigned variables anymore
# and your program needs to account for that.

# You may write any additional functions you require to solve this problem.
